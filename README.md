# TypeScript Exercises

This repository contains a series of TypeScript exercises designed to help improve your understanding and skills with TypeScript. Each exercise focuses on a different aspect of TypeScript, such as variable declarations, type aliases, functions, classes, and a basic calculator implementation.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Variable Declarations
1. Declare a variable that holds a string value without explicitly stating its type.
2. Declare a variable that holds a number value and explicitly state its type.
3. Declare a variable that can hold a value of any type.
4. Declare a variable that can hold either a string or a number.

### Exercise 2: Type Aliases
1. Create a type alias for a union type that can be either a string or a boolean.

**File:** `exercise2.ts`

### Exercise 3: Functions
1. Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
2. Write a function that returns a fixed number.
3. Write a function that takes a string and an optional boolean parameter. If the boolean is true, return the string in uppercase; otherwise, return it in lowercase.

**File:** `exercise3.ts`

### Exercise 4: Classes
1. Create a `Person` class with `name` and `age` properties. Implement a method to return the person's name.
2. Add a private property `socialSecurityNumber` to the `Person` class and a method to get the age.

**File:** `exercise4.ts`

### Exercise 5: Basic Calculator
Objective: Create a basic calculator class in TypeScript that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The class should include validation to ensure that the inputs are valid numbers and that division by zero is handled correctly.

**Requirements:**
1. Class Definition:
   - Create a `Calculator` class with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Validation:
   - Implement input validation to ensure the provided values are numbers.
   - Ensure that the division method handles division by zero appropriately.
3. Methods:
   - `add`
   - `subtract`
   - `multiply`
   - `divide`

**File:** `exercise5.ts`
